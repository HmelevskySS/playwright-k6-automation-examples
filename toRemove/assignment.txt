QA Automation & Performance
Senior Quality Engineer – Automation & Performance Assessment
Introduction
This assessment is designed to evaluate the skills of a Senior Quality Engineer with strong
experience in test automation

Playwright) and performance testing.
We are not only interested in whether things work, but how you think:
Test design and structure
Reliability and maintainability
Performance reasoning and interpretation
Engineering trade-offs and clarity of communication
The assessment consists of two practical tasks and a short reflection section.
Expected time investment:
3
4 hours

Tools: Playwright + one performance testing tool of your choice

Practical Assignment
Task 1
UI Automation with Playwright
Target application:

Requirements
Implement automated UI tests using Playwright that cover the following scenarios:
Successful login using:
Username: standard_user
Failed login using:
Username: locked_out_user
Add a product to the cartw
Start the checkout process
Technical Expectations
https://www.saucedemo.com

Use Playwright Test with a clean project structure
Use fixtures or reusable setup logic
Use explicit waits and Playwright best practices
No hardcoded sleeps ( sleep , waitForTimeout )
Ensure tests are:
Deterministic
Readable
Maintainable
Provide a CLI command to run the tests locally
Include a README explaining:
How to run the tests
Any design decisions you made
Optional
Bonus
Configure Playwright to run in GitHub Actions
Add:
HTML test reports
Screenshots or traces on failure
Evaluation Criteria
Test structure and readability
Correct use of Playwright APIs
Reliability and stability of tests
Reusability and maintainability
Quality of documentation

Task 2
Performance Testing
Target API:

Tool (choose one):
k6 (preferred)
JMeter
Artillery
Scenario
https://reqres.in/api/users?page=1

Simulate 100 concurrent users
Each user sends 1 request per second
Test duration: reasonable to capture stable metrics (explain your choice)
Metrics to Capture
Response time:
P50
P95
P99
Error rate
Throughput (requests/sec)
Deliverables
Performance test script
Short performance report including:
Test setup and assumptions
Captured metrics
Interpretation of results
Potential optimization suggestions (even if the system is simple)
Evaluation Criteria
Correct test setup and execution
Proper metrics collection
Ability to interpret results
Clarity and realism of conclusions
Understanding of performance testing principles

Reflection & Seniority Check
Please answer briefly in the README or a separate document:
How would you integrate Playwright tests into CI/CD?
How would you notify the team

Slack/Teams) about failures or regressions?
What observability metrics would you include in an end-to-end quality dashboard?
How would you decide:
What to automate
What not to automate

What belongs to performance vs functional testing
Short, pragmatic answers are sufficient.)

Submission Instructions
Submit via:
GitHub repository (preferred)
or ZIP archive
Include:
Source code
README with setup and explanations
Performance report

Markdown or PDF

What We Are Looking For
This is not about perfection.
We value:
Clean, pragmatic engineering
Good testing instincts
Clear communication
Senior-level reasoning and trade-offs
